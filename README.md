# Raymania
Raymania is a 2D top down racing game inspired by Trackmania.
It is also somewhat of a follow up to my previous project, Web Racer.

The game is made using:
 - Raylib 5.0
 - c language

## Compiling

Download Raylib 5.0 and this repository.
On Linux, you can export a linux build by
opening the terminal in this repository and running:

`make raymania.out`

Or if you want a windows build run:

`make raymania.exe`

These commands will make an executable file.
