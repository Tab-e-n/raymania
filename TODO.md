# NEEDS FIXING

Demos don't save if their subdirectory doesn't exist yet
Pause sound effect
Racecar sound effects are glitchy and sound bad
Not enough info about the game's controls
When track starts, and your car is offscreen, load\_placement or whatever doesn't update
Reduce main to not be 3700 lines long
Big blocks go outside of map fix
Collisions take into account multiple lines
Collisions still suck ass so fix them
(This may be fixed, not sure) Random loud noise fix
Cant esc out of party
Cant esc out of main menu play submenu


# DO NEXT

Held piece in editor is transparent
angular velocity?
Start draws a racecar in editor
Different zoom for different cars?
Page button instead pulls up a large piece catalogue with more blocks
Env and Car buttons show selected option without needing to press them
Select directory when saving

Start Race sfx
Move Block sfx

Assets can have unique rotated sprites
Blocks have more pieces
Tracks have more blocks
Removing Tracks, Profiles and Replays


# EXTRA

Custom Typing Sound sfx
Standartized menus
Block area rotation (same equation as racecar rot)
Deleting bigger size blocks when not at their origin (might be too slow with current track structure)
