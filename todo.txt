Party Mode like OG Trackmania
 - Multiple profiles, users choose max and code uses MALLOC (no) to allocate space for prof
 - Choosing profiles in profile menu
 - You can choose the amount of time for each player
 - Choose track or make track
 - Profiles take turns driving, each have an onscreen timer
 - Timer ticks down, once 0 player loses and is out
 - First goes the player with the biggest time, then from the first to the last
 - Validate -> play
 - Exiting race or editor goes to selecting profiles
